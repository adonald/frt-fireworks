                <p>No, it's a bunch of volunteers from across the community. Led by the Farnham Round Table we have helpful volunteers from various groups (Scouts, PTAs, Farnham Youth Choir, 41 Club). The council review our event management plans and provide us with the bookings to use the park, car parks and approve the road closures but other than that they are not directly involved!</p>

Please be considerate of where you park and do not block any entrances or cause an issue for other vehicles to pass. There are a number of car parks about the town, note that Waggon Yard is closed for the torchlit procession. https://www.waverley.gov.uk/Services/Parking/Car-parks/Farnham-car-parks</p>
                <p>Even better, do consider using public transport!.</p>

                <summary class="title is-5">Is the event suitable for wheelchair users?</summary>
                <p>The event is in the park which is primarily grass and it normally gets muddy. There are a few tarmac footpaths and small areas of hard standing throughout the park, but you will be limited in where you can go. We also have Birdies incorporated into the event which provides another area you can go to in a wheelchair.</p>

                <p>We would advise to avoid bringing a pram if at all possible. The park does get muddy, so make sure it is suitable for off-road conditions. Also note that the park is on a hill and there are steep sections to get to the event. If you are coming from the town centre you will want to come up and leave during the road closures as otherwise you will have to deal with the Bishops Steps which is about 50 steps up to the castle.</p>

                <summary class="title is-5">Can I bring sparklers?</summary>

Additionally local groups that assist with the event receive a donation for their efforts.</p>
                <p>Obviously there are many expenses in running an event like this, but costs are kept down by relying on volunteers and the good will of the community!</p>
                <p>The Farnham Round Table has regular meetings throughout the year to respond to any requests from funds.</p>

            <details Name="faq" class="box">
                <summary class="title is-5">What happens if the event is cancelled?</summary>
                <p>If the event is cancelled (eg due to Met Office severe weather warnings) then we will look to minimise costs as much as possible. Tickets are a non-refundable donation to Farnham Round Table in aid of local causes within our community. We will need to cover costs incurred by the event and we will then make communications to all ticket holders in terms of next steps and any options we are able to put forwards.</p>

                <summary class="title is-5">How long has the fireworks and procession been run for?</summary>
                <p>Honestly longer than anyone can remember! There's a long history of fireworks and processions in Farnham (see this one from 1865!). The Farnham Round Table have been running it since 1976 and have generated lots of money for the local community as well as making a memorable event for the town.</p>

                <p>We only build the bonfire the day before the event so there is minimal risk any little critters have decided to make a home in the bonfire.</p>

                <p>The costs of a drone display are currently prohibitive for an event of our size, it's something we will monitor for the future.</p>
